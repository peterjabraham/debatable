### Product Design Review (PDR) Document**. This section outlines the detailed steps for building, testing, and deploying the youtube/audio solution.

### 3. Product Design Review (PDR) Document
**3.1. Objectives & Scope**
* **Objectives:**
  * Enable users to upload structured PDFs (this exists already - check codebase) OR input YouTube/podcast URLs.
  * Automatically extract debate topics, subtopics, and supporting evidence using advanced NLP from transcripts.
  * Integrate the extracted data seamlessly into live debate sessions.
  * Ensure a responsive, accessible UI with real-time processing notifications. Users can wait but they need to see it’s processing or be notified it’ll be ‘x’ time and to wait/check back.
* **Scope:**
  * Frontend updates (Next.js 15 with TailwindCSS & Zustand).
  * Backend enhancements using Next.js API routes, serverless functions, OpenAI integration, and LangChain.
  * Data persistence and notifications via Firebase/Firestore.
  * Check current codebase and functionality, we want to limit breaking anything that works right now.
  * Consider the youtube and audio integration as a separate function to PDF upload (e.g. an additional panel to enter the url next to PDF upload)

⠀**3.2. Architecture & System Design**
* **Frontend Components:**
  **1** **Upload Interface:**
  * File upload and URL input components with client-side validation (this exists for PDF so check codebase).
  * Integration of the ThinkingIndicator to show processing status.
  **2** **Debate Panel Updates:**
  * Extend existing debate UI components to fetch and display debate topics and evidence.
* **Backend Services:**
  **1** **API Endpoints:**
  * **Upload Endpoint:** Handles file/URL submission, validates inputs, and enqueues jobs.
  * **Notification Endpoint:** Manages real-time user notifications using WebSocket/Firebase.
  **2** **Processing Pipeline:**
  * **PDF Extraction:** Use a Node.js PDF parsing library to extract text (exists already - check codebase)
  * **Transcription:** Integrate a third-party or custom transcription service for audio/video content.
  * **NLP Processing:**
  * Use LangChain and GPT-4o for topic extraction and semantic clustering.
  * Structure outputs into JSON with debate topics, subtopics, and citations.
  **3** **Data Storage:**
  * Store processed data in Firestore with clear metadata, status, and relational links to the user.
* **Integration:**
  * Ensure smooth integration with existing expert generation and context management modules in the debate system.

⠀**3.3. Development Plan & Milestones
1** **Phase 1: Requirements & Design**
	* Finalize requirements and PDR document.
	* Create detailed design diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, sequence diagrams) for the upload process and NLP pipeline.
**2** **Phase 2: Frontend & Backend Development**
	* **Frontend:**
		* Build file/URL upload components with input validation.
		* Integrate status notification and debate panel updates.
	* **Backend:**
		* Develop API endpoints for uploads, processing queue, and notifications.
		* Integrate PDF extraction and transcription modules.
		* Develop NLP agents with LangChain for topic extraction.
**3** **Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
	* **Unit Testing:**
		* Write tests for each API endpoint and processing module.
		* Validate NLP extraction accuracy using sample structured reports and audio files.
	* **Integration Testing:**
		* End-to-end tests simulating user uploads, processing, and debate panel retrieval.
	* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
		* Beta testing with a limited user set (limit uploads to 5) to refine the process.
**4** **Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring**
	* Deploy using the current Next.js deployment pipeline and Firebase hosting for backend serverless functions.
	* Set up monitoring (error logging, performance metrics) using Firebase and custom logging.
	* Roll out notifications for real-time processing status updates.

⠀**3.4. Testing Strategy**
* **Unit Tests:**
  * Validate the extraction logic for both PDFs and transcribed text.
  * Test input validations (file size, type, upload limits).
* **Integration Tests:**
  * Simulate complete user flows from upload to debate topic retrieval.
  * Verify data integrity in Firestore.
* **Performance Testing:**
  * Load test API endpoints to ensure they handle multiple concurrent uploads (up to 5 per user).
  * Stress test NLP processing to monitor latency and response times.
* **Security Testing:**
  * Ensure file uploads are sanitized.
  * Validate authentication/authorization for data retrieval.

⠀**3.5. Deployment & Rollout Plan**
* **Staging Environment:**
  * Deploy a staging version for internal QA and UAT.
  * Perform security and performance assessments.
* **Production Deployment:**
  * Use incremental rollout (feature flag for new upload functionality).
  * Monitor real-time performance and user feedback.
* **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
  * Utilize Firebase’s monitoring tools.
  * Establish a rollback plan in case of critical issues.

This concludes the detailed PDR document for the build. 
Examples** section next, where I provide concrete scenarios and illustrations of the solution in action

Below is **Section 4: Examples**, where I illustrate concrete scenarios for both user interactions and backend processing flows. After the examples, I’ll ask three deeper-thinking questions to help uncover further insights and connections.

### 4. Examples
**Example 1: PDF Upload and Debate Topic Extraction
1** **User Action:**
	* A user logs into the app and selects the “Upload PDF” option.
	* They upload a structured research report (PDF) about climate change.
**2** **Frontend Process:**
	* The file upload component validates the file type, size (within the standard limit), and checks that the user has not exceeded the 5-upload limit.
	* A ThinkingIndicator appears as the file is uploaded.
**3** **Backend Processing:**
	* The API endpoint receives the PDF, extracts the text using a PDF parser.
	* The extracted text is passed to the LangChain-based NLP module with GPT-4o, which identifies major debate topics (e.g., "Renewable Energy vs. Fossil Fuels") along with subtopics.
	* Supporting evidence and citations (e.g., paragraphs discussing scientific studies) are clustered under each topic.
**4** **Data Storage & Notification:**
	* The processed output is structured in JSON and stored in Firestore.
	* Once processing completes, a real-time notification is sent to the user via the app.
**5** **Debate Interaction:**
	* During a debate session, when the user selects the “Renewable Energy vs. Fossil Fuels” topic, the app queries Firestore and presents the relevant extracts and citations on the debate panel.

⠀**Example 2: YouTube/Podcast Link Processing
1** **User Action:**
	* A user pastes a YouTube link to a recorded debate on economic policy.
**2** **Frontend Process:**
	* The URL input is validated and sent to the API endpoint.
	* The ThinkingIndicator signals that processing has begun.
**3** **Backend Processing:**
	* The system first calls a transcription service to convert the audio content into text.
	* The transcribed text is then processed using the same NLP pipeline to extract debate topics (e.g., “Economic Growth vs. Income Equality”) and the associated supporting extracts.
**4** **Data Storage & Notification:**
	* The final structured output is saved in Firestore with metadata linking it to the user.
	* The user receives an in-app update that the content is ready.
**5** **Debate Interaction:**
	* During the debate, the user can select the extracted topics to view detailed arguments, counterpoints, and evidence retrieved from the original video.

⠀**Example 3: End-to-End Integration in a Debate Session
1** **User Action & Expert Interaction:**
	* During a live debate, a user selects a topic generated from their uploaded content.
	* The debate panel shows dynamically retrieved evidence that supports the expert’s viewpoint.
**2** **Dynamic Context Management:**
	* The expert generation module uses the structured debate topics and evidence to generate refined expert statements in real time.
	* The context management system integrates these extracts to maintain a coherent debate narrative.
**3** **User Experience:**
	* The user sees a smooth transition between expert-generated content and the supporting evidence from their uploads, facilitating an enriched debate experience.
