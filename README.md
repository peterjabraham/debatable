## Port Management

When running the development server, it's important to ensure the application consistently runs on port 3000 to maintain proper API functionality and prevent connection issues.

### Port Conflict Solutions

If you encounter the warning `Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead`, here are several ways to resolve this:

1. **Manually Kill the Process**
   ```bash
   # Find processes using port 3000
   lsof -i:3000
   
   # Kill the process
   kill $(lsof -t -i:3000)
   ```

2. **Create an Automated Start Script**
   Create a `start.sh` script in your project root:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Kill any process using port 3000
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
   # Start the app
   npm run dev
   ```
   Make it executable: `chmod +x start.sh`
   
3. **Use Docker for Development**
   Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     debate-app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       volumes:
         - .:/app
         - /app/node_modules
       environment:
         - NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Specify Port in Package.json**
   Update your npm scripts in package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "next dev -p 3000",
     "build": "next build",
     "start": "next start -p 3000"
   }
   ```

5. **Use Cross-Env for Environment Variable Management**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev cross-env
   ```
   Then update your scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "cross-env PORT=3000 next dev",
     "build": "next build",
     "start": "cross-env PORT=3000 next start"
   }
   ```

Choosing one of these approaches will help ensure the application consistently runs on port 3000, maintaining proper API functionality.

### Running in Production Mode
After building, start the production server with:
```bash
npm run start
```

### ### The Ultimate Debate-Enhanced Note-Taking & Knowledge Curation App

# üîÆ Why This is a Game-Changer
‚úîÔ∏è **Transforms passive knowledge consumption into active debate.**‚úîÔ∏è **Eliminates echo chambers** by exposing users to opposing views.‚úîÔ∏è **Perfect for students, journalists, and deep thinkers.**‚úîÔ∏è **Encourages users to refine arguments through real-time, voice-driven dialectics.**

# ### Refining the AI's Knowledge Engine for Authentic Expert Responses
For this app to be **truly valuable**, the AI needs to generate **highly authentic** expert responses that feel **coherent, nuanced, and historically or factually accurate**‚Äînot just generic AI summaries. Here's how we can refine the **AI's knowledge engine** to ensure **credibility, accuracy, and engaging debate quality**.

# üß† How the AI Constructs Expert Responses
To generate expert-level arguments that sound *real* and *contextually accurate*, we need a **multi-layered knowledge system** with **real-time validation**. Here's the **framework**:
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Layered Data Sources for Debate Generation
To make **each expert's argument feel true to their real-life beliefs**, the AI will reference multiple **verified sources**:
* **üìñ Primary Sources**: Books, essays, academic papers by the expert.
* **üì∞ Context-Specific References**: Interviews, public debates, blog posts.
* **üìú Philosophical & Political Writings**: Foundational arguments from history.
* **üéôÔ∏è Speech & Voice Archives**: Transcripts of actual speeches (e.g., TED Talks, historic addresses).
* **üì° Real-Time Web Crawling (Optional)**: Fetches the latest references if a topic is evolving (e.g., AI ethics, climate change).

‚†Äüîπ **Example:** If the debate is on *"Should universal basic income (UBI) exist?"*, the AI would pull from:
* üìñ **Primary Source**: Andrew Yang's UBI proposal.
* üìú **Historical Context**: Keynes on automation & job loss.
* üì∞ **Counterarguments**: Milton Friedman's writings on free markets.

‚†ÄEach argument would be **structured in the debater's real voice and ideology**, rather than sounding like generic AI synthesis.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Expert Persona Modeling ‚Äì Keeping Debates Authentic
The AI needs to **simulate** famous thinkers **as if they were actually speaking**. To do this, it will:
‚úÖ **Use their actual sentence structure & vocabulary.**
* Einstein's responses should be **thoughtful, exploratory, scientific**.
* Nietzsche's responses should be **bold, provocative, aphoristic**.
* Elon Musk's arguments should **lean toward technology optimism, market-driven solutions**.

‚†Ä‚úÖ **Incorporate their well-known beliefs & biases.**
* If debating AI, Alan Turing should reference **his work on computing and intelligence**.
* If debating capitalism, Karl Marx should lean into **his critique of labor and class struggle**.

‚†Ä‚úÖ **AI Style Transfer for Voice Consistency.**
* Uses **fine-tuned LLMs** to keep responses **tonally consistent** with real historical writing styles.
* Example: Nietzsche's **hyperbolic and poetic style** vs. Bertrand Russell's **calm, structured logic**.

‚†Ä
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Fact Validation (Avoiding Hallucinations)
Since **AI can sometimes generate false information**, we introduce **real-time knowledge verification**:
**1** **Pre-Debate Accuracy Check**
	* Before generating responses, AI checks its **sources against real writings**.
	* Flags **uncited claims** and searches for a **real quote, example, or reference**.
**2** **Fact-Level Transparency for Users**
	* The app highlights **where each claim comes from** (e.g., *Plato's "Republic", Ch.5*).
	* Users can **tap a claim** and see the **original source**.
**3** **User-Guided Rebuttal Requests**
	* If a response **feels off**, users can ask: *"Would this expert have really said that?"*
	* The AI **self-audits** and offers a **fact-checked revision**.

‚†Ä
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Multi-Expert Expansion
The AI can **expand the debate dynamically** by:
‚úÖ **Introducing New Perspectives Mid-Debate**
* Example: If Elon Musk & Alan Turing are debating AI, the AI might **pull in Jaron Lanier** as a wildcard **AI ethics critic**.

‚†Ä‚úÖ **Historical vs. Modern Matchups**
* Lets users **pit different eras against each other** (e.g., *Socrates vs. Sam Harris on ethics*).

‚†Ä‚úÖ **Cross-Domain Experts**
* On a topic like AI, the AI might **expand beyond computer scientists** to **psychologists, artists, and philosophers**.

‚†Ä
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Realistic, Dynamic Debate Tone Adjustments
Instead of **one-size-fits-all debates**, the AI adapts:
‚úîÔ∏è **Academic Style** ‚Äì Formal, structured, citation-backed.‚úîÔ∏è **Casual Debate** ‚Äì Witty, conversational, Socratic.‚úîÔ∏è **Intense Argument** ‚Äì More aggressive, rapid back-and-forth.‚úîÔ∏è **Historical Accuracy Mode** ‚Äì Uses only **verified real-world statements**.
Users can **switch debate styles** at any time.

# üöÄ Why This is Groundbreaking
‚úîÔ∏è **Moves beyond generic AI debates into deeply researched, expert-level discussions.**
‚úîÔ∏è **Simulates high-level discourse that would never happen in real life (e.g., Aristotle debating quantum physics).**
‚úîÔ∏è **Enhances knowledge-building, critical thinking, and intellectual engagement.**
‚úîÔ∏è **Provides high-quality, fact-checked arguments in real-time‚Äîbetter than reading 100 opinion articles.**

## üìà Development Status

## New Feature: Document-Based Responses

The application now supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide factual responses based on uploaded documents. When a user uploads a PDF document, the system:

1. Extracts text from the document
2. Splits the text into manageable chunks
3. Creates vector embeddings for each chunk
4. Stores these embeddings in a vector database (Pinecone)
5. Retrieves relevant content when questions are asked
6. Incorporates this content into AI responses

This ensures that expert responses are grounded in the factual content of the uploaded documents rather than relying solely on the AI model's general knowledge.

### Setup for Document-Based Responses

To enable this feature, you need to:

1. Create a Pinecone account at [pinecone.io](https://www.pinecone.io/)
2. Create a new index with the following settings:
   - Dimensions: 1024 (for OpenAI embeddings)
   - Metric: Cosine
   - Pod Type: Starter (for development)
3. Add your Pinecone API key, environment, and index name to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=gcp-starter
   PINECONE_INDEX=debate-documents
   ```

### Development Mode

If you don't want to set up Pinecone during development, you can use the mock implementation by setting:

```
USE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

This will use a simple in-memory storage for document chunks and basic keyword matching for retrieval.

## Port Management

When running the development server, it's important to ensure the application consistently runs on port 3000 to maintain proper API functionality and prevent connection issues.

### Port Conflict Solutions

If you encounter the warning `Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead`, here are several ways to resolve this:

1. **Manually Kill the Process**
   ```bash
   # Find processes using port 3000
   lsof -i:3000
   
   # Kill the process
   kill $(lsof -t -i:3000)
   ```

2. **Create an Automated Start Script**
   Create a `start.sh` script in your project root:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Kill any process using port 3000
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
   # Start the app
   npm run dev
   ```
   Make it executable: `chmod +x start.sh`
   
3. **Use Docker for Development**
   Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     debate-app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       volumes:
         - .:/app
         - /app/node_modules
       environment:
         - NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Specify Port in Package.json**
   Update your npm scripts in package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "next dev -p 3000",
     "build": "next build",
     "start": "next start -p 3000"
   }
   ```

5. **Use Cross-Env for Environment Variable Management**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev cross-env
   ```
   Then update your scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "cross-env PORT=3000 next dev",
     "build": "next build",
     "start": "cross-env PORT=3000 next start"
   }
   ```

Choosing one of these approaches will help ensure the application consistently runs on port 3000, maintaining proper API functionality.
